# Installation Gin

### Requirements

Before installing Gin, ensure that you have Go programming language installed on your system. If you haven't installed Go yet, please refer to the official [Go installation guide](https://golang.org/doc/install) for instructions.

> **Note:** Gin requires Go version 1.13 or above.

### Installation Steps

To install Gin, simply run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```

This command will download and install Gin and its dependencies into your Go workspace.

Once the installation is complete, you can import Gin into your Go projects and start building web applications using the framework.

### Verifying the Installation

To verify that Gin has been installed successfully, create a new Go file and import the `github.com/gin-gonic/gin package`. Build and run a sample application to ensure Gin is working correctly.

Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    // Creates a gin router with default middleware
    r := gin.Default()

    // Define a handler
    r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        // Use the gin context to return a response with a
        // a 200 status (usnig http.StatusOK)
        c.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello, Gin!")
    })

    r.Run(":8080")
}
```

Save the above code in a file named `main.go`, and then run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the following output:

```bash
[GIN-debug] Listening and serving HTTP on :8080
```

Now you can open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the "Hello, Gin!" message.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Gin and created a simple Gin web application. You are now ready to explore Gin's features and start building powerful web applications and APIs.
